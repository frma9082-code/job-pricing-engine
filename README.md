Contractor Profit Command System (CPCS)

Contractor Profit Command System is a financial control platform built specifically for remodel contractors who want predictable profit, stable cash flow, and structured growth.

Most contractors chase revenue. Very few control margin.

CPCS provides a centralized command layer that calculates true job cost before signing a contract. It factors in labor burden, overhead allocation, target profit, and contingency to prevent underbidding and silent profit leaks.

This is not accounting software. It does not replace QuickBooks. It sits above it as a strategic decision engine contractors use before bidding, hiring, expanding, or taking on new work.

Core Capabilities

• Bid Intelligence Engine — Calculates required selling price to hit target profit
• Break-Even Calculator — Shows exact monthly revenue required to survive
• Margin Tracking — Reveals real gross and net margin per job
• Scenario Modeling — Stress-tests labor increases, material spikes, and discounts
• Profit Guardrails — Warns against unsafe bids before submission

What It Solves

• Inconsistent estimating
• Thin margins disguised as growth
• Cash flow instability
• Revenue growth without profit growth
• Emotional discounting during negotiations

Who It’s For

Owner-operators and small remodel companies generating $500K–$3M annually who want financial clarity without hiring a full-time controller.

Revenue without control creates stress.
Revenue with margin intelligence creates stability.

CPCS turns reactive contracting into controlled profit execution.
